WEB SCRAPING

Web scraping is one of the automated processes for gathering extensive information from the World Wide Web. The information found on the websites is disorganized. In order to store this data in a more organized fashion, web scraping is a useful tool. Online services, application programming interfaces (APIs), and custom code are just some of the options for scraping websites.You can accomplish web scraping through many methods, but many prefer Python due to its ease of use, large collection of libraries and easily understandable syntax.
